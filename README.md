# GradeBoost
GradeBoost started with Professor Victor Norman’s request for a centralized platform for managing students’ grade appeals. Before GradeBoost, it took a lot of effort to keep track of grade appeals via email, as the conversations were scattered throughout Professor Norman’s email inbox. With GradeBoost, we aimed to solve this problem by developing a service for students to submit, track, and resolve grade appeals without them getting lost in Professors’ inboxes, and for Professors to more easily manage and keep track of their students’ appeals.

# Why GradeBoost?
- Centralized and Streamlined Process: Say goodbye to scattered emails and cluttered inboxes! GradeBoost provides a centralized platform for students to submit, track, and resolve grade appeals effortlessly. No more lost appeals or overlooked messages.
- User-Friendly Interface: Our intuitive interface makes navigating through courses and submitting assignment-specific appeals a breeze. Students can easily track the progress of their appeals, receive updates, and engage in seamless communication with professors through a dedicated discussion thread.
- Efficient Professor Dashboard: Professors, rejoice! The centralized dashboard allows you to view all student appeals at a glance. Respond, reassign appeals, forward them to graders, and utilize pre-written templates to streamline your responses. GradeBoost is designed to make your life easier.
- Interactive Discussion Threads: Foster effective communication with your professors through dynamic discussion threads. Share thoughts, seek clarification, and engage in meaningful conversations to ensure your voice is heard.
- Templates for Efficiency: Professors, save time with our pre-written templates designed to assist you in crafting timely and effective responses. Streamline your workflow and focus on what matters most – educating and supporting your students.
